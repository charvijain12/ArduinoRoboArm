# Robotic Arm using Arduino
Mini Project for Smart Manufacturing

This project that involves building a robotic arm controlled by an Arduino board. The arm is designed to have six degrees of freedom and is capable of moving in a variety of directions and angles.

The code is written in C++ language and is designed to be uploaded to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

The project involves using servo motors to control the movement of the arm, and the code provides instructions for controlling each servo motor individually. The user can input commands to move the arm in a specific direction, as well as control the speed and angle of movement.

The model is designed to fit the necessary components and can be assembled according to the provided instructions.
