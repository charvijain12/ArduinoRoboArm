# Robotic Arm using Arduino
The Robotic Arm using Arduino project is a mini project designed for smart manufacturing. The project involves the creation of a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm using an Arduino board. The arm's movement is controlled using servo motors, and the control code is written in C++ and can be uploaded onto the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

The project provides users with the ability to control the arm's movement in various directions and angles. The user can input commands that direct the arm to move in a specific direction while having control over the speed and angle of movement.

To build the robotic arm, the necessary components include six popsicle sticks, a U-shaped PVC attachment for the arm, four rubber bands, a PVC pipe with a diameter of 50mm, a PVC pipe with a diameter of 20mm, a casing for electrical PVC wire, a micro Farad capacitor, a 6V adapter, an Arduino Uno board, wires specifically for the Uno board, and a servo motor capable of rotating to different angles.

The project aims to create a functional robotic arm that can be utilized for various manufacturing applications. The accompanying image provides a visual representation of the robotic arm.
