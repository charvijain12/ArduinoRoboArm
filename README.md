# Robotic Arm using Arduino
This project implements a robotic arm controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The arm consists of multiple segments connected by servo motors that can be controlled using a remote control. The project uses Arduino programming to control the servo motors and to read input from the remote control.

The robotic arm can be used for various applications such as picking and placing objects in industrial automation, sorting objects in a warehouse, and many more. The arm can be controlled remotely using the remote control, making it easy to operate and maneuver.

The project includes a detailed description of the hardware components used and how they are connected to the Arduino microcontroller. The software implementation is also described in detail, including the programming logic and control flow.

The project is open source and can be customized and modified to suit specific requirements. The project is suitable for anyone interested in robotics and automation and provides an opportunity to learn about the basics of robotics and how to control robotic arms using Arduino.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need an Arduino board, servo motors, a remote control, and other hardware components. You will also need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer to program the Arduino board.

The project includes a detailed list of hardware components and instructions on how to connect them to the Arduino board. It also includes the source code for the Arduino program that controls the robotic arm.

## Usage
The robotic arm can be controlled using the remote control included in the project. The remote control allows the user to move the robotic arm in different directions and control the servo motors connected to the arm.

The project also includes sample code that demonstrates how to control the robotic arm using Python and MATLAB. This provides flexibility in how the arm can be controlled and integrated with other systems.
