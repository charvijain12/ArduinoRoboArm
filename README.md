The above description outlines a mini project that involves creating a robotic arm using an Arduino board for smart manufacturing. The arm has six degrees of freedom, allowing it to move in various directions and angles. The control code is written in C++ and can be uploaded onto the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

To control the movement of the arm, servo motors are used and the code provides instructions for controlling each servo motor independently. The user has the capability to input commands that can direct the arm to move in a specific direction while also having control over the speed and angle of movement.

The necessary components required for the project include six popsicle sticks, a U-shaped PVC attachment for the arm, four rubber bands, a PVC pipe with a diameter of 50mm, a PVC pipe with a diameter of 20mm, a casing for electrical PVC wire, a micro Farad capacitor, a 6V adapter, an Arduino Uno board, wires specifically for the Uno board, and a servo motor capable of rotating to different angles.

The project aims to create a functional robotic arm that can be utilized for various manufacturing applications. The accompanying image provides a visual representation of the robotic arm.
