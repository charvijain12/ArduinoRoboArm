# ArduinoRoboArm: Six-Degree-of-Freedom Robotic Arm Project
The ArduinoRoboArm project is a mini project designed for smart manufacturing. It involves the creation of a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm using an Arduino board. The arm's movement is controlled using servo motors, and the control code is written in C++ and can be uploaded onto the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Project Overview
The ArduinoRoboArm project showcases the implementation of a versatile and compact robotic arm that can be used in various industrial and educational applications. It provides an example of how to build a robotic arm using readily available components and Arduino technology.

## Features
- Six degrees of freedom for precise and flexible movement.
- Arduino-based control system, making it easy to program and customize.
- Utilizes servo motors for controlled motion.
- Ideal for educational purposes and small-scale automation tasks.

## Hardware Requirements
To build the robotic arm, you'll need the following components:
1. Arduino board
2. Servo motors
3. Mechanical components for the arm
4. Power supply

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (for programming)

## Usage
Here's how to get started with your ArduinoRoboArm:
1. Assemble the robotic arm using the specified mechanical components and servo motors.
2. Write or upload the control code using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the system and control the arm's movement as needed.
